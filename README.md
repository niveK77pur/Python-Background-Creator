# Python-Background-Creator
This module lets you create a bunch of background images for your presentation slides without having to fiddle around and redo the exact same steps each and every time for every image you want to treat in order to use as a background.

Please refer to the attached manual for more information on how to use this module. In case you wonder why it is so large in size, it is mainly due to the high resolution images you will find in the appendix section. So have a close look :)
